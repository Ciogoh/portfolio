**Holestello** is a modular construction system based on repeated wooden elements, holes, elastics, and connectors. The system operates through bodily actions such as building, twisting, tightening, and releasing. Rhythm, tension, and repetition define how parts connect and transform. Simple components enable open-ended configurations, allowing structures to be assembled, adjusted, and reconfigured through slow, hands-on interaction within a compact scale.
