The project consists of reproducing the Lierna chair using Finnish cardboard, with a strong focus on structure and proportions. The main model is built at a 1:2 scale, while a selected structural detail is reproduced at 1:1 scale to better investigate construction logic, material behavior, and construction clarity. The work emphasizes precision, cleanliness, and how cardboard can clearly express structural relationships.
