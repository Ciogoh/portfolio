From images, words, and open themes, magazines take shape. Typography marks time, layout records space. Fragments become rhythm, pages turn into visual narratives that extend beyond the image, lingering between gaze, thought, and material presence.

**Traces - A visual research on movement, paths, and the marks they leave.**
Every movement leaves a trace. Sometimes it becomes a path, a line carved by repetition, by choosing the same way again and again. Other times it appears as a mark: a momentary gesture, a curve drawn in passing, almost disappearing as soon as it appears

This book looks at both. At the terrains that shape how we move. At the paths that emerge because we cross them. At the flow built through bodies in motion, and at the marks that remain—intentional or accidental, fragile or persistent. A trace is never just a line. It is evidence, memory, direction, and possibility. It is where movement becomes visible.
